Neural network implementation from scratch using NumPy to understand core deep learning concepts
# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository demonstrates my understanding of the **core fundamentals of deep learning** by implementing a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy.

Rather than relying on high-level frameworks, this project focuses on the underlying mathematics and logic that power modern deep learning systems.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to show that I understand **how neural networks actually work**, not just how to use libraries.

The model is built from the ground up and includes:
- forward propagation
- loss computation
- backpropagation
- gradient descent–based weight updates


## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Neural network architecture design
- Forward & backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Numerical computation with NumPy
- Writing clean, modular Python code
- Translating theory into working code


## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (training loss visualization)

No deep learning frameworks were used in order to emphasize strong fundamentals.


## Project Structure
neural-network-from-scratch/ │── train.py        # Model training loop │── model.py        # Neural network implementation │── utils.py        # Mathematical helper functions │── requirements.txt │── README.md


## How to Run

1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Train the model
python train.py


## Results

- The model successfully learns by minimizing loss over multiple epochs
- Training behavior validates correct implementation of backpropagation
- Loss trends are visualized to monitor learning performance


## What This Project Shows Recruiters

- I understand the **mathematical foundations** behind deep learning
- I can implement algorithms, not just call APIs
- I write readable, well-structured code
- I am building toward advanced deep learning and AI roles


## Next Steps

- Extend to multi-layer networks
- Experiment with different activation functions
- Apply the architecture to real-world datasets
- Re-implement using PyTorch for performance comparison


## About Me

I am an aspiring **Machine Learning / Deep Learning Engineer** actively building projects to strengthen my practical and theoretical skills.  
I am currently seeking **internship or entry-level opportunities** where I can contribute, learn, and grow.
